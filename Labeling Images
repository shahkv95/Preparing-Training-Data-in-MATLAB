%The labels needed for training can be stored in the Labels property of the image datastore. By default, the Labels property is empty.

You can have the datastore automatically determine the labels from the folder names by specifying the 'LabelSource' option.%


load pathToImages
flwrds = imageDatastore(pathToImages,'IncludeSubfolders',true);
flowernames = flwrds.Labels

flwrds = imageDatastore(pathToImages,'IncludeSubfolders',true,'LabelSource','foldernames')

%Extract the Labels property of flwrds into a variable called flowernames.%

flowernames = flwrds.Labels

%Note that the labels are automatically read from the folder names and stored as a categorical array. 
These labels are critically important to the training process.

If your image files are not organized in this way, you will need to manually modify the Labels property to be a categorical 
array of image labels.%
